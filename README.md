# iceira_social_layers

iceira_social_layers is the package in which we host all related costmap layers solely for research purposes. The social costmap layers are used as some sort of "plugins" for move_base to notice the proxemics for social and dynamic environment.

# 1. Motivation

This project is created to enhance the autonomous navigation and especially on avoiding collision and violation to personal spaces. The different of these layers is that the layers should be updated at higher frequency than static layers so to monitor at real-time the personal distances of all standing pedestrians in motion.
